### ℹ️ About this project

This is a Project I was required to do as a part of IEFP's Front-end Developer Course in order to help with applying for jobs.

The project isn't entirely mine from scratch as I was required to follow a tutorial on Youtube.

I changed the entire design to match my preferences, added my own information and projects. 

The design is responsive.
